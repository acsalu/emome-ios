# emome-ios
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/emome/emome-ios.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/emome/emome-ios)

### CocoaPods
We use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) for iOS package management.

1. Install CocoaPods with `sudo gem install cocoapods` in your terminal.
2. Use `pod install` to install all the package dependencies.
3. Open Emome.xcworkspace from now on.


### Suggestions from db:

1. Minimize the features you have to build in a MVP (Server side implementation could be excluded from our MVP)
2. Good story of 'Group Therapy'
3. 'Weather' might be a good start
